## Instructions on getting started

In the project directory, and checkout `develop` branch.\
This is because `develop` branch will most probably be ahead of `master` branch.

Before you get started please install 
**You’ll need to have Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.


Run the following commands:

### `yarn install`

This installs app dependencies being used.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
